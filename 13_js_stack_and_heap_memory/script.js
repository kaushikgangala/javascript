// Stack
// stores primitive types such as number, string, etc
// Variables storing primitive values directly contain the actual value
// also stores stack frames(execution context) for local variables whenever a function is called

// Heap
// stores non-primitive types such as function definitions, arrays, objects
// Objects and arrays created on the heap are referenced by variables stored on the stack.
